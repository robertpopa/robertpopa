<h1 align="center"> Hi, I'm Robert Popa 👋 </h1>


<h4 align="justify"> I’m a Senior Full-Stack Java Developer with 16+ 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 building scalable, secure, and high-performance web applications. </h4>

<p>My strength lies in backend development using Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate, with production-grade experience on AWS and DevOps integration. I also have frontend experience with Angular and React, enabling me to contribute across the entire stack when needed. 
  
I’ve worked on complex systems in industries like automotive, finance, energy, oil & gas, collaborating with distributed teams and delivering high-quality code on time.

I am AWS, SAP and ITIL certified, demonstrating my proficiency and professionalism in the field. 

Also I'm fluent in English, Spanish, and German (basic competency), and enjoy working with cross-cultural teams and stakeholders.

I’m currently open to freelance or contract opportunities—especially with startups or tech-driven teams that value clean code and long-term thinking.

Let’s connect if you need help shipping quality software that scales.
